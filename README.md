## My process

### Built with

- Semantic HTML5 markup
- Flexbox
- CSS Grid
- Mobile Responsive
- [React](https://reactjs.org/) - JS library
- [Styled Components](https://styled-components.com/) - For styles


### What I learned

in this project, I use react js and styled components as a medium to design components easily and quickly.

Here an example of styled-components syntax ðŸ‘‡

```html
<h1>Example Heading</h1>
```
```js
// import styled from 'styled-component
export const Heading = styled.h1`
  font-size: 20px;
  color: blue;
`
```

```js
// import { Heading } from 'styled.js'
<Heading>Example Component</Heading>
```

From the example above, we used the styled-component to change the size and color of the h1. By using styled-component it will be easier to design the component and maintain it.


### Useful resources

- [Styled Components](https://styled-components.com/) - Styled Components is a tools that helped me to styling components with actuall CSS code in JavaScript. I'd recommend it to anyone who want to styling a component in React with this tool.
